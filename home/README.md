# Home-Manager Configuration

This directory contains the home-manager configurations for user-specific settings and programs. The configurations are organized into subdirectories based on their category (e.g., `browser/`, `cli/`, `desktop/`).

Each subdirectory contains modules related to that specific category, allowing for a modular and organized approach to managing user environments.
